# skincare-experimentation-dashboard

Create an experimentation platform where there is a dashboard where you can see what actions were taken in the past and how those actions moved metrics such as retailers acquired and marketplace orders placed for a skincare brand. I should be able to look at multiple options of actions to take and then select one.
